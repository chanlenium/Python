### Programming language developed with intuitive and concise grammar, gaining the most popularity 
(Reference: [tiobe-index](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/, "tiobe-index link"))
### Special features of Python

<ol type="1">
  <li><b>Script language</b></li>
  Python is a Script language in which interpreters read source codes line by line at a run-time and execute it immediately without a compilation.<br>
  This makes it easy to code while immediately viewing and modifying the execution results.<br>
  <br>
  <li><b>Dynamic typing</b></li>
  Python does not specify the datatype of a variable, but can specify a value simply by declaring it.<br> 
  The data type of the variable is determined when the code is executed.<br>
  <br>
  <li><b>General-purpose programming language</b></li>
  A general-purpose programming language (GPL) is a programming language designed to be used for building software in a wide variety of application domains, across a multitude of hardware configurations and operating systems.
